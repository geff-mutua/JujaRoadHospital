        'description'=>'Juja Road hospital offers pre delivery counseling for all mothers a few days before admission for delivery. 
        It is normal for a mother to feel anxious about the birthing process. During the pre-delivery counseling, we teach our clients 
        what to expect in the labour room. We help them understand what the patients should expect from the healthcare providers and
         they also know what is expected from them. We help our clients understand the whole process of labor and how to handle the pain successfully.
          If an expectant mother is scheduled for a caesarean section, we help them prepare for the session beforehand and counsel them on the expectations when in the theatre.
           This creates memorable patient experiences for our clients. Pre delivery counseling is critical in prevention of postpartum depression and other health challenges associated with childbirth.',
